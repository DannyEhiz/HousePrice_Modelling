# Lagos House Price Prediction

<!-- Description -->
This project centers on deploying predictive models using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap in Streamlit, leveraging scraped data from Nigeria Property Center. Focused on prime areas like Ikeja, Victoria Island, Agege, Ajah, Gbagada, Lekki, Yaba, and Ikoyi, the dataset captures diverse house listings. Through web scraping, the project gathered detailed property attributes, including type, location, price, square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities, forming the basis for analysis and model development.

Utilizing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap within Streamlit enabled seamless model deployment in a user-friendly interface. The integration of these technologies allowed for responsive design, ensuring an engaging user experience. The models, ranging from price estimation to market trends analysis, were developed using varied machine learning algorithms, aiming to offer insights and forecast property demand while uncovering influential features in Nigeria's real estate market.
